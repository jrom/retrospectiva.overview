# Overview Extension
## for the Retrospectiva PM Rails app

Still in pre-alpha version, just started coding it from the default retro\_wiki and retro\_blog extensions shipped with the software.

### Contributions will be appreciated

## Installation

Just copy the content of this repository to the `extensions/overview/` directory (you will have to create it) and then install it with the `script/rxm install overview` command.
After that you will have to activate it for each project from the web Admin panel.

Step-by-step commands:

    cd retrospectiva_root_dir
    cd extensions
    git clone git://github.com/jrom/retrospectiva.overview.git overview
    script/rxm install overview
